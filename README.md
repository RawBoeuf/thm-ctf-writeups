# RawBoeuf's TryHackMe Capture the Flag (CTF) Writeups  
üö© **Capture the Flag** üö©
This repository will be storing my writeups for portfolio reasons and for anyone who wants to learn. I'm still a beginner in Cyber Security, but I hope this becomes a useful resource for someone trying to kickstart their career in CyberSec.

This is still heavily under construction, I hope you find my explanations useful as I try to explain with my limited knowledge. As I myself am a beginner, I will try my best to make my explanations detailed and beginner friendly.

## Recommended Resources
Here is a list of recommended resources for those wanting to learn CyberSecurity.
### Theory
- [Network Chuck's Free CCNA Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3VtYsD80AdGkLBXTTkh2Dxw70yWnerh) - Great way to learn networking basics.
- [PC Security Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel) - An amazing channel that shows and explains a lot of recent CyberSecurity events such as the LinusTechTips hack. It is nice to get an explanation of recent events and makes CyberSecurity more practical.
- [MentalOutlaw]() - This channel is definitely not for everyone. The owner of this channel is a heavy advocate of Internet Privacy which not everyone is so this channel is more for personal privacy. In the beginning, you're introduced to certain tools such as Burp Suite, Metasploit, Gobuster, and Hashcat. But, unless you're already in CyberSecurity, you're not going to be using these tools much outside of a service like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, or VulnHub. 
### Practice
This is a list of resources for learning and/or practicing your CyberSecurity skills.
- [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) - Theory/Practice - **FREE** (Some Rooms Require Premium) - The platform that this writeup repository uses. I recommend subscribing to the premium edition if you can. If you're a student, use your student discount. 
- [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) - Theory/Practice - **FREE** - HackTheBox is similar to TryHackMe as it has a lot of theory that is followed by a hands-on practical. I haven't used this too much as of 7/2/23, but that's not because it's a bad resource. The one downside is that you have to finish your room before you can move on to a different one if you use the free version. I'm just more focused on TryHackMe because I've got premium but this is a great resource.
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - Practice - **FREE** - Vulnhub has a bunch of Virtual Machines (VMs) that you can practice compromising. I've only learned about this recently and haven't gotten the opportunity to try it myself, but it looks like a good resource and I've heard great things about it. There's also a great resources page that you can use for learning theory.
- [PicoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org) - Practice - **FREE** - This is a great way to practice. It's a completely free resource but I only recommend this after you go through a few TryHackMe rooms. PicoCTF is run by Carnegie Mellon University and when you sign up you're given your own web shell environment to complete the CTF challenges. General Skills is really easy and the best place to start before moving on to the other categories.
- [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/) - Practice - **FREE** - The basic section of this site is exactly that extremely basic. This resource was recommended to me through an Introduction to Cybersecurity and Information Insurance class that I took at University.
- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) - Practice - **FREE** - I have barely touched this, but it looks like a great hands-on practice website. I'll definitely give this more justice when I actually use it.
